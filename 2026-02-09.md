1. "Muddiest Moment" At the end of each day, look at your notes and identify at least one of the things that is the opposite of #1 below

2. Every morning after today we will begin with a random selection with these questions:
    - What do you remember that was helpful from yesterday
    - What was cool and you want to learn more about?

    That is to say, takes notes.


Notes:

    - Foam is really cool and I want to implement it more
    - I want to get better at shortcuts
