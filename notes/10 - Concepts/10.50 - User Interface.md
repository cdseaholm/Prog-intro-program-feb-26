# User Interface

## Angular

### Angular CLI

- Get the package: 
    - npm install --global @angular/cli@latest
    - use ng on cmd line for angular

    - Other commands:
        - dotnet tool install -g csharprepl
        - npm install -g npm@[version] for npm update to version (and have node)
            - need to make it's on path
    

- Making project:
    - ng new -t -s --skip-tests --skip-git angular-demo
        - -t = templates
        - -s = inline styles
        - angular-demo is name


- Open
    - cd into new folder
    - "code ." in cmd to open up new instance of vs code
        - Don't want a nested folder in vs code
    - "code -r ." to use open window
    - ng serve to compile and run (or npm run start)

- Set up and folder is similar to React
    - Package, tsconfig, postcss, public, etc.

- Actual pages are differen though:
    - imports are the same as React
    - How you build the component is different though
        - built in app.routes instead of Next.js router/nav
        - uses tailwind
        - index.html is like root layout
    - app.ts
        - use selector for
        - secondary import?
        - template is the actual html render
        - styles: [] since inline?
        - export with some extra definitions
    - Here is app.ts as an ex:

```
    import { Component, signal } from '@angular/core';
    import { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';

    @Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    imports: [RouterOutlet],
    template: `
        <h1>Hello, {{ title() }}</h1>

        <router-outlet />
    `,
    styles: [],
    })
    export class App {
    protected readonly title = signal('angular-demo');
    }
```

## Jeff folder structure

src/app/nav/nav.ts
src/app/pages/home-page.ts -etc

## General Knowledge

1. <ng-content></ng-content> is basically the same as {children} or a JSX.Element passed from the parent in React.
