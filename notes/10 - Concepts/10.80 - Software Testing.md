# General Testing notes

    1. Unit Test file: ./TestFolderName.Tests/UnitTest.cs:

        - In here you write (public void-generally?) functions that use "Assert.Equal(expected, answer);"
        - To add params, you can use "[Theory]\n[InlineData(3,3,6)]" So that 3 and 3 are your params and 6 is your expected
        - You can use fact for void/non-param functions/etc to make sure it doesn't break
        - Example:

        ```
        public class UnitTest1
        {
            [Fact]
            public void CanAddTenAndTwenty()
            {
                // Arrage - Given
                int a = 10;
                int b = 20;
                int answer;

                // Act - When
                answer = a + b;
                // Assert - Then 
                Assert.Equal(30, answer);
            }

            [Theory]
            [InlineData(10,20,30)]
            [InlineData(2,2,4)]
            [InlineData(3,3,6)]
            public void CanAddOtherIntegersToo(int a, int b, int expected)
            {

                int answer = a + b;
                Assert.Equal(expected, answer);
            }
        }

        ```

        2. Above example doesn't use Function from externals that you may truly be using.
            
            - For this, you'd just import the function and use it within the test function and return the vals it returns or not
