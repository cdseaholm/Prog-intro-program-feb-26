# Git

 - Decentralized 
 - There are copies of repos and there is a single authority


# Github

 - Is now Microsoft
 - Place to store your copies/source control
 - Azure DevOps is Microsofts version

# What to store here

 - Code that you and your team OWN and change
 - Don't sotre other stuff like:
    - Libraries you use (dlls, etc) - explicity declare and isolate dependencies
    - Other teams code
    - even things like images, stuff like that - be careful

# How can it store it all?

 - It's usually not all code AND changes
 - Usually a current version and then changes of copies only
