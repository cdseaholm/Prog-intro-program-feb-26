# Software Architecture / Systems Architecture

# Explaining using src/BankingSolution, Note that it is in a Testing set up

    1. "Types" as I would know it, but in this example it's Account is found in Banking.Domain
        - Note, this isn't actually a type like in React/TypeScript. It's a class that has functions/attributes associated with it
        - This includes functions related to Accounts (public and private)

    2. Banking.Tests
        - Tests where you are defining Theory/Facts and throwing in props

    3. In the api example
        - There is no defined "Domain" section where "types" are
        - Most in under _Filename_.api 
            - See 10.40.10 - HTTP Apis.md for more


# Subtypes

    1. If you have different types of a type (Like with example of Gold Account, Regular Account, Plat Account, etc), you can override base functions with "public override etc..." to set that "subtype"

        - So if you do base.Deposit(amt + 1.1M) where 1.1M is a bonus from the bank, then Gold Override base.Deposit(amt + 1.2M), where if it is a Gold account, the Deposit function is overriden.
            - Note that the above syntax is not correct, see the src/week1/bankingSolution for better syntax
