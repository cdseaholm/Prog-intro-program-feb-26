# A List of things you want to learn more about

1. Best practices:
    - UI
        - Handling UI Clutter
        - Multiple menus
            - Modern practices
    - Backend and Object/Type creation
        - I tend to make a lot of smaller types but not sure if I should be making larger all-encompassing types
    - API Routes/Helper
        - I tend to have a helder that I can call from my Client side, then have that helper interact with API route
            - So not sure if this is a good way to do it or not
    - Github
        - Rebasing/Merging in Github?
            - Sometimes I'll forget to pull changes and then make new changes to my local and so then I can't push changes without pulling the previous ones, and then I have to do some work around stuff to merge both.
            
        - ANSWER (In class 2/9): 
            - How to prevent first:
                - Get latest changes often
                - Don't let code ferment locally, push code once a day
            - Structure your app/code in a way that no two devs should have an excuse to work on the same file at the same time
                - This is why we tend to have a lot of small files
                - organize code base around "business features" instead of tech concerns
            - If merge conflicts happen:


    - Security
        - Only attack I really know how to protect against is 

2. Testing
    - Probably my weakest ability
        - Done a bit with Jest, but it was really basic
